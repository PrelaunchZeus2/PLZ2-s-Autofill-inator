# Autofill-inator
This is a short piece of code I wrote when I was teaching myself python and the Riot API.
It takes in a username and roughly determines the number of autofilled players in a League of Legends Match and prints their names.
The algorithm is very rough and just checks which roles they played in the past with which role they played in game.
